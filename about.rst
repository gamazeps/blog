Who am I ?
==========

Hi all, I'm Felix Raimundo a Software Engineer and dabbling computer scientist
currently residing in Paris. During the day I write distributed systems in
Haskell and C at `Tweag I/O <https://tweag.io>`_.

I'm French and like computers, robots, beers and whisky.

I have also done some cool electronics project that you can see
`here <https://www.hackster.io/gamazeps>`_.

What is this ?
==============

This is my blog.

I'm planning on using it for documenting my progresses on a Rust crate I'm currently
working on: RobotS. `Robots <https://github.com/gamazeps/Robot>`_ is an Actor system
library implemented in pure Rust.

I'm also going to use it to post some robotics tutorial I wrote a while ago about
ChibiOS/RT.  
It's also going to be used as a place to write about my robotics experiments in the
near future
(ROS has been teasing me for a while...).

I might also post some rants here, as it is said to be what programmers do
(hopefully it will take a while for me to have a reason to rant).
