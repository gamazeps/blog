# Some realisations

Talking with some friends in bioinformatics made me relize that I do not
have the stuff to back my "senior" aspirations and that stings a bit.

Some serious grunt work seems to be needed even though it feels pointless.

Mathieu told me a week ago that he expected me to be able to get my senior
software engineer in about a year if I put in the work. Out of a spirit of
challenge I want to get that done in 6 months (even though his expectation was
more than generous on my abilities).

I propose an experience: spend the next 30 days cramming on Haskell and distributed
systems to be good at it and see how fast I can progress.

The only issue I have with this experiment is that except for the distributed systems
part, I am pretty sure that the skills I could get in that experience are not transferable.
For instance I would dream to be one day able to work at DeepMind
